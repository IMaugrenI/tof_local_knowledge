# Commands

> English is the primary text in this document. A German mirror is available in `commands_DE.md`.

This repository exposes a small public operator path so local startup and shutdown stay easy to understand.

## Standard command flow

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
bash scripts/up.sh
bash scripts/check.sh
bash scripts/logs.sh
bash scripts/down.sh
```

## Commands

- `bash scripts/setup.sh` — prepare `.env` and local directories
- `bash scripts/up.sh` — start the full stack through the public wrapper
- `bash scripts/check.sh` — run health checks for the live stack
- `bash scripts/logs.sh` — follow compose logs
- `bash scripts/pull.sh` — pull upstream images where available
- `bash scripts/down.sh` — stop the stack cleanly without deleting data
- `bash scripts/restart.sh` — restart through the public wrappers
- `bash scripts/reset.sh` — destructive reset for local service data and derived/export storage

## Notes

- `setup.sh` wraps the existing `bootstrap_dev.sh`
- `up.sh` wraps the existing `start_full.sh`
- `check.sh` wraps the existing `check_full.sh`
- `down.sh` is non-destructive by default
- `reset.sh` is the destructive path and should be used deliberately
